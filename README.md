# PredictIt-Betting
A series of web-scraping scripts that monitors various sites for changes. When a change is detected, a text alert is sent so that trades can be placed in the appropriate PredictIt market.

Note: the scripts send texts using Twilio text service. In order to use the scripts, the textmyself file must be installed so that it can be imported as a module, with the proper fields filled out for your Twilio text account.
